I have plans to implement some goodies not yet present in the kernel.\hypertarget{plans_plans_event_connect}{}\section{Event connecting}\label{plans_plans_event_connect}
Sometimes we need to wait, say, for messages from several queues simultaneously; currently, the kernel does not have built-\/in support of it. How I plan to implement it\+: there should be a way to {\itshape connect} an event group and custom events mask to the data queue. Then, data queue will maintain flag(s) specified by mask\+: when queue is non-\/empty, it will set flag(s) by mask, when queue becomes empty, it will clear these flag(s).

Then, we can connect single event group to several queues passing different flags, and wait for the messages from all of these queues with just a single call to {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__eventgrp_8h_aa905d986d188d4a0cc2f3974aad04896}{tn\+\_\+eventgrp\+\_\+wait()}}. When event happened, we just check which flags are set, and get message from appropriate queue.
