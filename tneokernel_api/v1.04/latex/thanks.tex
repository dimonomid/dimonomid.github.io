There are people that I would like to thank\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Yuri Tiomkin} -\/ for original T\+N\+Kernel. Although the implementation of T\+N\+Kernel is far from perfect in my opinion, the ideas behind the implementation are generally really nice (that's why I decided to reimplement it instead of starting from scratch), and it was great entry point to the real-\/time kernels for me;
\item {\bfseries Anders Montonen} -\/ for original implementation of T\+N\+Kernel-\/\+P\+I\+C32 port;
\item {\bfseries Alex Borisov} -\/ for T\+N\+Kernel port which I was using for a long time;
\item {\bfseries Alexey Morozov} and {\bfseries Alexey Gromov}, my chiefs in the \href{http://orionspb.ru/}{\tt O\+R\+I\+O\+N} company, for being flexible about my time;
\item {\bfseries Robert White} -\/ for nice ideas.

Thank you guys. T\+Neo\+Kernel would never be what it is without you.
