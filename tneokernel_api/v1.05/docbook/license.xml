<para>TNeo was born as a thorough review and re-implementation of TNKernel. The new kernel has well-formed code, inherited bugs are fixed as well as new features being added, and it is tested carefully with unit-tests.</para>

<para>API is changed somewhat, so it&apos;s not 100% compatible with TNKernel, hence the new name: TNeo.</para>
