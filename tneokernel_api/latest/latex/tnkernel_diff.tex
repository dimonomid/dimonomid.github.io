\hypertarget{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_api_sys_start}{}\subsection{System startup}\label{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_api_sys_start}
Original T\+N\+Kernel code designed to be built together with main project only, there\textquotesingle{}s no way to build as a separate library\+: at least, arrays for idle and timer task stacks are allocated statically, so size of them is defined at tnkernel compile time.

It\textquotesingle{}s much better if we could pass these things to tnkernel at runtime, so, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__sys_8h_a62ab25d9d8ca01c02d368968f19e49bf}{tn\+\_\+sys\+\_\+start()}} now takes pointers to stack arrays and their sizes. Refer to \hyperlink{quick_guide_starting_the_kernel}{Starting the kernel} section for the details.\hypertarget{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_task_create}{}\subsection{Task creation A\+PI}\label{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_task_create}
In original T\+N\+Kernel, one should give bottom address of the task stack to {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__tasks_8h_a548d5adda09d1b4e393b5df0e9e1a7a5}{tn\+\_\+task\+\_\+create()}}, like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#define MY\_STACK\_SIZE   0x100}
\textcolor{keyword}{static} \textcolor{keywordtype}{unsigned} \textcolor{keywordtype}{int} my\_stack[ MY\_STACK\_SIZE ];

\hyperlink{tn__tasks_8h_a548d5adda09d1b4e393b5df0e9e1a7a5}{tn\_task\_create}(\textcolor{comment}{/* ... several arguments omitted ... */}
               &(my\_stack[ MY\_STACK\_SIZE - 1]),
               \textcolor{comment}{/* ... several arguments omitted ... */});
\end{DoxyCode}


Alex Borisov implemented it more conveniently in his port\+: one should give just array address, like this\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\hyperlink{tn__tasks_8h_a548d5adda09d1b4e393b5df0e9e1a7a5}{tn\_task\_create}(\textcolor{comment}{/* ... several arguments omitted ... */}
               my\_stack,
               \textcolor{comment}{/* ... several arguments omitted ... */});
\end{DoxyCode}


T\+Neo uses the second way (i.\+e. the way used in the port by Alex Borisov), and it does so independently of the architecture being used.\hypertarget{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_wakeup_count}{}\subsection{Task wakeup count, activate count, suspend count}\label{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_wakeup_count}
In original T\+N\+Kernel, requesting non-\/sleeping task to wake up is quite legal and causes next call to {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__tasks_8h_ae768a72ca0efde5767796cc1770bd45e}{tn\+\_\+task\+\_\+sleep()}} to not sleep. The same is with suspending/resuming tasks.

So, if you call {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__tasks_8h_abb88bc8b1cec6b82e7b6e2e90d0e155a}{tn\+\_\+task\+\_\+wakeup()}} on non-\/sleeping task first time, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__oldsymbols_8h_a71970f860643e62fad7ec03076bdc1d8}{T\+E\+R\+R\+\_\+\+N\+O\+\_\+\+E\+RR}} is returned. If you call it second time, before target task called {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__tasks_8h_ae768a72ca0efde5767796cc1770bd45e}{tn\+\_\+task\+\_\+sleep()}}, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__oldsymbols_8h_abfe40d04917509ecd3a98c38878df5ff}{T\+E\+R\+R\+\_\+\+O\+V\+E\+R\+F\+L\+OW}} is returned.

All of this seems to me as a complete dirty hack, it probably might be used as a workaround to avoid race condition problems, or as a hacky replacement for semaphore.

It just encourages programmer to go with hacky approach, instead of creating straightforward semaphore and provide proper synchronization.

In T\+Neo these \char`\"{}features\char`\"{} are removed, and if you try to wake up non-\/sleeping task, or try to resume non-\/suspended task, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__common_8h_aa43bd3da1ad4c1e61224b5f23b369876a7b6d93374f52ba4b2fc01b38b783aa4c}{T\+N\+\_\+\+R\+C\+\_\+\+W\+S\+T\+A\+TE}} is returned.

By the way, {\ttfamily suspend\+\_\+count} is present in {\ttfamily T\+CB} structure, but is never used, so, it is just removed. And comments for {\ttfamily wakeup\+\_\+count}, {\ttfamily activate\+\_\+count}, {\ttfamily suspend\+\_\+count} suggested that these fields are used for statistics, which is clearly not true.\hypertarget{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_fmem}{}\subsection{Fixed memory pool\+: non-\/aligned address or block size}\label{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_fmem}
In original T\+N\+Kernel it\textquotesingle{}s illegal to pass {\ttfamily block\+\_\+size} that is less than {\ttfamily sizeof(int)}. But, it is legal to pass some value that isn\textquotesingle{}t multiple of {\ttfamily sizeof(int)}\+: in this case, {\ttfamily block\+\_\+size} is silently rounded up, and therefore {\ttfamily block\+\_\+cnt} is silently decremented to fit as many blocks of newly calculated {\ttfamily block\+\_\+size} as possible. If resulting {\ttfamily block\+\_\+cnt} is at least 2, it is assumed that everything is fine and we can go on.

Why I don\textquotesingle{}t like it\+: firstly, silent behavior like this is generally bad practice that leads to hard-\/to-\/catch bugs. Secondly, it is inconsistency again\+: why is it legal for {\ttfamily block\+\_\+size} not to be multiple of {\ttfamily sizeof(int)}, but it is illegal for it to be less than {\ttfamily sizeof(int)}? After all, the latter is the partucular case of the former.

So, T\+Neo returns {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__common_8h_aa43bd3da1ad4c1e61224b5f23b369876a89909a6426b477a38496a1be67590e68}{T\+N\+\_\+\+R\+C\+\_\+\+W\+P\+A\+R\+AM}} in these cases. User must provide {\ttfamily start\+\_\+addr} and {\ttfamily block\+\_\+size} that are properly aligned.

T\+Neo also provides convenience macro {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__fmem_8h_ab45e9c2ad4a64345214f9a912bf76fc3}{T\+N\+\_\+\+F\+M\+E\+M\+\_\+\+B\+U\+F\+\_\+\+D\+E\+F()}} for buffer definition, so, as a generic rule, it is good practice to define buffers for memory pool like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{comment}{//-- number of blocks in the pool}
\textcolor{preprocessor}{#define MY\_MEMORY\_BUF\_SIZE    8}

\textcolor{comment}{//-- type for memory block}
\textcolor{keyword}{struct }MyMemoryItem \{
   \textcolor{comment}{// ... arbitrary fields ...}

The actual error is, of course, wrong state, not wrong context; so, T\+Neo returns {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__common_8h_aa43bd3da1ad4c1e61224b5f23b369876a7b6d93374f52ba4b2fc01b38b783aa4c}{T\+N\+\_\+\+R\+C\+\_\+\+W\+S\+T\+A\+TE}} in these cases.\hypertarget{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_release_wait}{}\subsection{Force task releasing from wait}\label{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_release_wait}

Note\+: for old T\+N\+Kernel projects, there is a compatibility mode, see {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__cfg__default_8h_ac61d5f6a716cdcab205a2c8afbde4242}{T\+N\+\_\+\+O\+L\+D\+\_\+\+E\+V\+E\+N\+T\+\_\+\+A\+PI}}.

In original T\+N\+Kernel, I always found events A\+PI somewhat confusing. Why is this object named \char`\"{}event\char`\"{}, but there are many flags inside, so that they can actually represent many events?

Meanwhile, attributes like {\ttfamily T\+N\+\_\+\+E\+V\+E\+N\+T\+\_\+\+A\+T\+T\+R\+\_\+\+S\+I\+N\+G\+LE}, {\ttfamily T\+N\+\_\+\+E\+V\+E\+N\+T\+\_\+\+A\+T\+T\+R\+\_\+\+C\+LR} imply that \char`\"{}event\char`\"{} object is really just a single event, since it makes no sense to clear just {\bfseries all} event bits when some particular event happened.

After all, when we call {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__oldsymbols_8h_aee4d9866fcfb8b9b6a96066b288150dc}{tn\+\_\+event\+\_\+clear(\&my\+\_\+event\+\_\+obj, flags)}}, we might expect that {\ttfamily flags} argument actually specifies flags to clear. But in fact, we must invert it, to make it work\+: {\ttfamily $\sim$flags}. This is really confusing.

In T\+Neo, there is no such {\itshape event} object. Instead, there is object {\itshape events group}. Attributes like {\ttfamily ...S\+I\+N\+G\+LE}, {\ttfamily ...M\+U\+L\+TI}, {\ttfamily ...C\+LR} are removed, since they make no sense for events group. Instead, you may set the flag {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__eventgrp_8h_a9d42ee61ae8da342f1cd6440b7e54bbdaf45098235d31f72a2b09e30792686573}{T\+N\+\_\+\+E\+V\+E\+N\+T\+G\+R\+P\+\_\+\+W\+M\+O\+D\+E\+\_\+\+A\+U\+T\+O\+C\+LR}} when task is going to wait for some event bit(s), and then these event bit(s) will be atomically cleared automatically when task successfully finishes waiting for these bits.

T\+Neo also offers a very useful feature\+: connecting an event group to other kernel objects. Refer to the section \hyperlink{tn__eventgrp_8h_eventgrp_connect}{Connecting an event group to other system objects}.

But the port by AlexB implemented it differently (i.\+e. accordingly to the docs) \+: it takes size as an argument.

When I was moving from the port by AlexB to another one, do you have any idea how much time it took me to figure out why do I have rare weird bug? \+:)

By the way, additional strange thing\+: why doesn\textquotesingle{}t this macro have any prefix like {\ttfamily T\+N\+\_\+}?

T\+Neo provides macro {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__common_8h_a3f48380e8a624edc643319a81192d88e}{T\+N\+\_\+\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+A\+L\+I\+G\+\_\+\+S\+I\+Z\+E()}} whose argument is {\bfseries size}, so, its usage is as follows\+: {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__common_8h_a3f48380e8a624edc643319a81192d88e}{T\+N\+\_\+\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+A\+L\+I\+G\+\_\+\+S\+I\+Z\+E(sizeof(struct My\+Struct))}}.

But for compatibility with messy {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__oldsymbols_8h_aa42d2e6b5b7ff37bd485803fa2cb70a8}{M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+A\+L\+I\+G()}} from original T\+N\+Kernel, there is an option {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__cfg__default_8h_a2a1148efc6a74131cc83ee50cbc386cd}{T\+N\+\_\+\+A\+P\+I\+\_\+\+M\+A\+K\+E\+\_\+\+A\+L\+I\+G\+\_\+\+A\+RG}} with two possible values;

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Why do we have {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__dqueue_8h_af60c61c12ed90f4bcc7d13ca4da8562b}{tn\+\_\+queue\+\_\+send\+\_\+polling()}} / {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__dqueue_8h_ac059f15f07625ca25e4aac5790cce1ea}{tn\+\_\+queue\+\_\+isend\+\_\+polling()}} (notice the {\ttfamily i} letter before the verb, not before {\ttfamily polling}), but {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__fmem_8h_affea42ad41734fadfe8170b4234ca567}{tn\+\_\+fmem\+\_\+get\+\_\+polling()}} / {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__oldsymbols_8h_a4293c359514306825a9007f071b2ad3f}{tn\+\_\+fmem\+\_\+get\+\_\+ipolling()}} (notice the {\ttfamily i} letter before {\ttfamily polling})?
\item All the system service names follow the naming scheme {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+$<$noun$>$\+\_\+$<$verb$>$\mbox{[}\+\_\+$<$adjustment$>$\mbox{]}()}, but the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__oldsymbols_8h_a566625be14a6eed4a3574e3d31e776fc}{tn\+\_\+start\+\_\+system()}} is special, for some strange reason. To make it consistent, it should be named {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+system\+\_\+start()} or {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__sys_8h_a62ab25d9d8ca01c02d368968f19e49bf}{tn\+\_\+sys\+\_\+start()}};
\item A lot of macros don\textquotesingle{}t have {\ttfamily T\+N\+\_\+} prefix;
\item etc
\end{DoxyItemize}

So, a lot of things (functions, macros, etc) has renamed. Old names are also available through {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__oldsymbols_8h}{tn\+\_\+oldsymbols.\+h}}, which is included automatically if {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__cfg__default_8h_ae9854c723c6a823c9126aa8390977d39}{T\+N\+\_\+\+O\+L\+D\+\_\+\+T\+N\+K\+E\+R\+N\+E\+L\+\_\+\+N\+A\+M\+ES}} option is non-\/zero.\hypertarget{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_api_rename_sem}{}\subsection{We should wait for semaphore, not acquire it}\label{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_api_rename_sem}
One of the renamings deserves special mentioning\+: {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__oldsymbols_8h_abdc5c428590ff525cdb566da613015ce}{tn\+\_\+sem\+\_\+acquire()}} and friends are renamed to {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__sem_8h_acfed2a27719c87638d2eb6edfdeea150}{tn\+\_\+sem\+\_\+wait()}} and friends. That\textquotesingle{}s because names acquire/release are actually misleading for the semaphore\+: semaphore is a {\itshape signaling mechanism}, and {\bfseries not} the locking mechanism.

Actually, there\textquotesingle{}s a lot of confusion about usage of mutexes/semaphores, so it\textquotesingle{}s quite recommended to read small article by Michael Barr\+: \href{http://goo.gl/YprPBW}{\tt Mutexes and Semaphores Demystified}.

Old names ({\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__oldsymbols_8h_abdc5c428590ff525cdb566da613015ce}{tn\+\_\+sem\+\_\+acquire()}} and friends) are still available through {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__oldsymbols_8h}{tn\+\_\+oldsymbols.\+h}}.\hypertarget{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_other}{}\section{Changes that do not affect A\+P\+I directly}\label{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_other}
\hypertarget{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_timer_task}{}\subsection{No timer task}\label{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_timer_task}
Yes, timer task\textquotesingle{}s job is important\+: it manages {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+wait\+\_\+timeout\+\_\+list}, i.\+e. it wakes up tasks whose timeout is expired. But it\textquotesingle{}s actually better to do it right in {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__sys_8h_aa44d297639e0520420890ef2bb7e2c1c}{tn\+\_\+tick\+\_\+int\+\_\+processing()}} that is called from timer I\+SR, because presence of the special task provides significant overhead. Look at what happens when timer interrupt is fired (assume we don\textquotesingle{}t use shadow register set for that, which is almost always the case)\+:

(measurements were made at P\+I\+C32 port)


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Current context (23 words) is saved to the interrupt stack;
\item I\+SR called\+: particularly, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__sys_8h_aa44d297639e0520420890ef2bb7e2c1c}{tn\+\_\+tick\+\_\+int\+\_\+processing()}} is called;
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__sys_8h_aa44d297639e0520420890ef2bb7e2c1c}{tn\+\_\+tick\+\_\+int\+\_\+processing()}} disables interrupts, manages round-\/robin (if needed), then it wakes up {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+timer\+\_\+task}, sets {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+next\+\_\+task\+\_\+to\+\_\+run}, and enables interrupts back;
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__sys_8h_aa44d297639e0520420890ef2bb7e2c1c}{tn\+\_\+tick\+\_\+int\+\_\+processing()}} finishes, so I\+SR macro checks that {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+next\+\_\+task\+\_\+to\+\_\+run} is different from {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+curr\+\_\+run\+\_\+task}, and sets {\ttfamily C\+S0} interrupt bit, so that context should be switched as soon as possible;
\item Context (23 words) gets restored to whatever task we interrupted;
\item {\ttfamily C\+S0} I\+SR is immediately called, so full context (32 words) gets saved on task\textquotesingle{}s stack, and context of {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+timer\+\_\+task} is restored;
\item {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+timer\+\_\+task} disables interrupts, performs its not so big job (manages {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+wait\+\_\+timeout\+\_\+list}), puts itself to wait, enables interrupts and pends context switching again;
\item {\ttfamily C\+S0} I\+SR is immediately called, so full context of {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+timer\+\_\+task} gets saved in its stack, and then, after all, context of my own interrupted task gets restored and my task continues to run.
\end{DoxyItemize}

I\textquotesingle{}ve measured with M\+P\+L\+A\+BX\textquotesingle{}s stopwatch how much time it takes\+: with just three tasks (idle task, timer task, my own task with priority 6), i.\+e. without any sleeping tasks, all this routine takes {\bfseries 682 cycles}. So I tried to get rid of {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+timer\+\_\+task} and perform its job right in the {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__sys_8h_aa44d297639e0520420890ef2bb7e2c1c}{tn\+\_\+tick\+\_\+int\+\_\+processing()}}.

Previously, application callback was called from timer task; since it is removed now, startup routine has changed, refer to \hyperlink{quick_guide_starting_the_kernel}{Starting the kernel} for details.

Now, the following steps are performed when timer interrupt is fired\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Current context (23 words) is saved to the interrupt stack;
\item I\+SR called\+: particularly, {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__sys_8h_aa44d297639e0520420890ef2bb7e2c1c}{tn\+\_\+tick\+\_\+int\+\_\+processing()}} is called;
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__sys_8h_aa44d297639e0520420890ef2bb7e2c1c}{tn\+\_\+tick\+\_\+int\+\_\+processing()}} disables interrupts, manages round-\/robin (if needed), manages {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+wait\+\_\+timeout\+\_\+list}, and enables interrupts back;
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__sys_8h_aa44d297639e0520420890ef2bb7e2c1c}{tn\+\_\+tick\+\_\+int\+\_\+processing()}} finishes, I\+SR macro checks that {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+next\+\_\+task\+\_\+to\+\_\+run} is the same as {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+curr\+\_\+run\+\_\+task}
\item Context (23 words) gets restored to whatever task we interrupted;
\end{DoxyItemize}

That\textquotesingle{}s all. It takes {\bfseries 251 cycles}\+: 2.\+7 times less.

So, we need to make sure that interrupt stack size is enough for this (not big) job. As a result, R\+AM is saved (since you don\textquotesingle{}t need to allocate stack for timer task) and things work much faster. Win-\/win.
