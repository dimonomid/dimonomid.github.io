Release date\+: 2014-\/10-\/20.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added a capability to connect an \hyperlink{tn__eventgrp_8h}{event group} to other system objects, particularly to the \hyperlink{tn__dqueue_8h}{queue}. This offers a way to wait for messages from multiple queues with just a single system call. Refer to the section \hyperlink{tn__eventgrp_8h_eventgrp_connect}{Connecting an event group to other system objects} for details. Example project that demonstrates that technique is also available\+: {\ttfamily examples/queue\+\_\+eventgrp\+\_\+conn}.
\item P\+I\+C32 Interrupts\+: this isn't a mandatory anymore to use kernel-\/provided macros {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__arch__pic32_8h_a46a860d030e59e2c6aa827ca5ad36a37}{tn\+\_\+soft\+\_\+isr()}} or {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__arch__pic32_8h_acb97f377bb993c30f6c83c582978d895}{tn\+\_\+srs\+\_\+isr()}}\+: interrupts can be defined with standard way too\+: this particular I\+S\+R will use task's stack instead of interrupt stack, therefore it takes much more R\+A\+M and works a bit faster. There are no additional constraints on I\+S\+R defined without kernel-\/provided macro\+: in either I\+S\+R, you can call the same set of kernel services. Refer to the page \hyperlink{interrupts}{Interrupts} for details.
\item Priority 0 is now allowed to use by application (in the original T\+N\+Kernel, it was reserved for the timer task, but T\+Neo\+Kernel \hyperlink{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_timer_task}{does not have timer task})
\item Application is now available to specify how many priority levels does it need for, it helps to save a bit of R\+A\+M. For details, refer to {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__cfg__default_8h_aad74a059c61567c68a1e9067ab47a256}{T\+N\+\_\+\+P\+R\+I\+O\+R\+I\+T\+I\+E\+S\+\_\+\+C\+N\+T}}.
\item Added example project {\ttfamily examples/queue} that demonstrates the pattern on how to use \hyperlink{tn__dqueue_8h}{queue} together with \hyperlink{tn__fmem_8h}{fixed memory pool} effectively.

Release date\+: 2014-\/10-\/14.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added \hyperlink{tn__timer_8h}{timers}\+: kernel objects that are used to ask the kernel to call some user-\/provided function at a particular time in the future;
\item Removed {\ttfamily tn\+\_\+sys\+\_\+time\+\_\+set()} function, because now T\+Neo\+Kernel uses internal system tick count for timers, and modifying system tick counter by user is a {\itshape really} bad idea.

Release date\+: 2014-\/10-\/09.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries F\+I\+X\+:} {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__dqueue_8h_a589bfb4d3966bc7405dcf959d7114544}{tn\+\_\+queue\+\_\+receive()}} and {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__fmem_8h_afb45a1f427b531b22f1f4b013f415ae0}{tn\+\_\+fmem\+\_\+get()}} \+: if non-\/zero {\ttfamily timeout} is in effect, then {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__common_8h_aa43bd3da1ad4c1e61224b5f23b369876a5b4d73fde6b5d1c9579c02e6aafce1fb}{T\+N\+\_\+\+R\+C\+\_\+\+T\+I\+M\+E\+O\+U\+T}} is returned, but user-\/provided pointer is altered anyway (some garbage data is written there). This bug was inherited from T\+N\+Kernel.
\item Added {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__tasks_8h_a18408d825c0dab03511f3aaeeb3ffbb3}{tn\+\_\+task\+\_\+state\+\_\+get()}}
\item {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__oldsymbols_8h_abdc5c428590ff525cdb566da613015ce}{tn\+\_\+sem\+\_\+acquire()}} and friends are renamed to {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__sem_8h_a6bf88a78f4f8b2799f72ee671b52ed97}{tn\+\_\+sem\+\_\+wait()}} and friends. More on this read \hyperlink{tnkernel_diff_tnkernel_diff_api_rename_sem}{here}. Old name is still available through {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__oldsymbols_8h}{tn\+\_\+oldsymbols.\+h}}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Initial stable version of T\+Neo\+Kernel. Lots of work done\+: thorough review and re-\/implementation of T\+N\+Kernel 2.\+7, implemented detailed unit tests, and so on.
