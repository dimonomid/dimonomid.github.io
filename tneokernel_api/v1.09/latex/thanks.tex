There are people that I would like to thank\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Yuri Tiomkin}} -\/ for original T\+N\+Kernel. Although the implementation of T\+N\+Kernel is far from perfect in my opinion, the ideas behind the implementation are generally really nice (that\textquotesingle{}s why I decided to reimplement it instead of starting from scratch), and it was great entry point to the real-\/time kernels for me;
\item \href{https://github.com/andersm}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Anders Montonen}}}} -\/ for original implementation of T\+N\+Kernel-\/\+P\+I\+C32 port;
\item {\bfseries{Alex Borisov}} -\/ for T\+N\+Kernel port which I used to use for a long time;
\item \href{http://starline.ru}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Star\+Line company}}}} -\/ for being a sponsor of kernel port for Cortex-\/M architecture as well as a couple of other \mbox{\hyperlink{features}{features}}\+: profiler, dynamic tick.
\item {\bfseries{Alexey Morozov}} and {\bfseries{Alexey Gromov}}, my chiefs in the \href{http://orionspb.ru/}{\texttt{ O\+R\+I\+ON}} company, for being flexible about my time;
\item {\bfseries{Robert White}} -\/ for nice ideas and participation;
