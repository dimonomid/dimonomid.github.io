T\+Neo has a complete set of common R\+T\+OS features plus some extras. Many features are optional, so that if you don\textquotesingle{}t need them you can configure the kernel as you wish and probably save memory or improve speed.\hypertarget{features_feature_list}{}\doxysection{Feature list}\label{features_feature_list}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{tn__tasks_8h}{Tasks}}, or threads\+: the most common feature for which the kernel is written in the first place;
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{tn__mutex_8h}{Mutexes}}\+: objects for shared resources protection.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Recursive mutexes}}\+: optionally, mutexes allow nested locking. Refer to the {\ttfamily \#T\+N\+\_\+\+M\+U\+T\+E\+X\+\_\+\+R\+EC} option for details;
\item {\bfseries{Mutex deadlock detection}}\+: if deadlock occurs, the kernel can notify you about this problem by calling arbitrary function. Refer to the {\ttfamily \#T\+N\+\_\+\+M\+U\+T\+E\+X\+\_\+\+D\+E\+A\+D\+L\+O\+C\+K\+\_\+\+D\+E\+T\+E\+CT} option for details.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{tn__sem_8h}{Semaphores}}\+: objects for tasks synchronization;
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{tn__fmem_8h}{Fixed-\/size memory blocks}}\+: simple and deterministic memory allocator;
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{tn__eventgrp_8h}{Event groups}}\+: objects containing various event bits that tasks may set, clear and wait for;
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{tn__eventgrp_8h_eventgrp_connect}{Event group connection}}\+: extremely useful feature when you need to wait, say, for messages from multiple queues, or for other set of different events.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{tn__dqueue_8h}{Data queues}}\+: F\+I\+FO buffer of messages that tasks may send and receive;
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{tn__timer_8h}{Timers}}\+: a tool to ask the kernel to call arbitrary function at a particular time in the future. The callback approach provides ultimate flexibility.
\item {\bfseries{Separate interrupt stack}}\+: interrupts use separate stack, this approach saves a lot of R\+AM. Refer to the page \mbox{\hyperlink{interrupts}{Interrupts}} for details.
\item {\bfseries{Software stack overflow check}}\+: extremely useful feature for architectures without hardware stack pointer limit. Refer to the {\ttfamily \#T\+N\+\_\+\+S\+T\+A\+C\+K\+\_\+\+O\+V\+E\+R\+F\+L\+O\+W\+\_\+\+C\+H\+E\+CK} option for details.
\item {\bfseries{Dynamic tick}}\+: if there\textquotesingle{}s nothing to do, don\textquotesingle{}t even bother to manage system timer tick each fixed period of time. Refer to the page \mbox{\hyperlink{time_ticks}{Time ticks}} for details.
\item {\bfseries{Profiler}}\+: allows you to know how much time each of your tasks was actually running, get maximum consecutive running time of it, and other relevant information. Refer to the option {\ttfamily \#T\+N\+\_\+\+P\+R\+O\+F\+I\+L\+ER} and {\ttfamily struct \#\mbox{\hyperlink{structTN__TaskTiming}{T\+N\+\_\+\+Task\+Timing}}} for details.
