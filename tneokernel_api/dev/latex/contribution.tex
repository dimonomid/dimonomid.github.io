Some guidelines on contribution to T\+Neo.\hypertarget{contribution_contribution_main}{}\section{Contribution}\label{contribution_contribution_main}
So you want to contribute to the kernel. That\textquotesingle{}s really cool! Then, please consider the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Please contact me first (\href{mailto:mail@dmitryfrank.com}{\tt mail@dmitryfrank.\+com} is probably the best), so that we can discuss changes you\textquotesingle{}re going to implement and ways to do that. It is really important to understand each other well, before actual work is done;
\item If you don\textquotesingle{}t have an account on \href{http://bitbucket.org}{\tt bitbucket.\+org} yet, create it;
\item Fork \href{https://bitbucket.org/dfrank/tneokernel}{\tt T\+Neo repository on bitbucket};
\item Perform needed changes in your own fork;
\item Create a pull request to main repository;
\item Your changes get merged into main T\+Neo repository. You\textquotesingle{}re done, thanks! Now, you\textquotesingle{}re free to delete your fork or keep it, as you wish.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{contribution_contribution_coding_standard}{}\section{Coding standard}\label{contribution_contribution_coding_standard}
I don\textquotesingle{}t have much to say on this topic. The most important and universal thing is\+: {\bfseries please see as other code is written and write in a similar manner}.

As an addition, I just want to emphasize several aspects that are often a subject to forget\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Set your editor so that it doesn\textquotesingle{}t use tabs, use exactly 3 spaces for indentation. By the way, you\textquotesingle{}re encouraged to read my article \href{http://dmitryfrank.com/articles/indent_with_tabs_align_with_spaces}{\tt Indent with tabs, align with spaces}, which explains how to use tabs properly. I really like the idea, but at the moment editors are unfortunately too dumb to follow these guidelines, and people (including me) generally aren\textquotesingle{}t ready to maintain these conventions manually, so, at least for now, the easiest and practical solution is to just use spaces only.
\item When you add or change something observable, explain it in \hyperlink{changelog}{Changelog}.
\item Don\textquotesingle{}t forget to write comments so that \href{http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/}{\tt doxygen} can parse them. You don\textquotesingle{}t have to learn doxygen manual for that, just look as others comments are written.
\item When you add new kernel option (to the file {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__cfg__default_8h}{tn\+\_\+cfg\+\_\+default.\+h}}), modify {\ttfamily \hyperlink{tn__cfg__dispatch_8h}{tn\+\_\+cfg\+\_\+dispatch.\+h}} as well\+: add a check that option macro is defined.
\end{DoxyItemize}

And thank you for contribution!
